Implement the selection mechanic -> if you touch a row/col, highlight it, and add it to 'symbols'
Figure out how I'm going to implement the recommendation system. Make a class Recommendation, that 
takes in a symbol list as its initializer
Plan out all of the recommendation mechanics
When nothing is selected on a chart, have a floating arrow that will point to a column or row
Have symbols enlarge on hover
Background Music
Have a counter for how many reps someone has gotten (requires backend)
Change play button art to a wug with a play button in the middle
Indicate to the user for the first time that they can highlight a cell
Phighting Phonetics
Think about logo


Questions to ask:
- How do I show/tell the user that they can select columns?
    Add tooltip/one time arrow pointing to something
- How do I show/tell the user that they can click on the buttons to replay the audio?
