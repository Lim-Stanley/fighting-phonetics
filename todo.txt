Implement the selection mechanic -> if you touch a row/col, highlight it, and add it to 'symbols'
Figure out how I'm going to implement the recommendation system. Make a class Recommendation, that 
takes in a symbol list as its initializer
Plan out all of the recommendation mechanics
Implement logic so that if you highlight all the columns, all the rows get highlighted too
Make error message for when someone selects a row with only one symbol, telling them to select other rows
    OR : HAVE THE PLAY BUTTON FADED (like a really light grey) when you cannot practice, and otherwise a 
    much bolder grey
When nothing is selected on a chart, have a floating arrow that will point to a column or row
Have symbols enlarge on hover
Background Music
Have a counter for how many reps someone has gotten (requires backend)
Change play button art to a wug with a play button in the middle
Indicate to the user for the first time that they can highlight a cell
