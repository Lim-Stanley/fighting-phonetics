Implement the selection mechanic -> if you touch a row/col, highlight it, and add it to 'symbols'
Figure out how I'm going to implement the recommendation system. Make a class Recommendation, that 
takes in a symbol list as its initializer
Plan out all of the recommendation mechanics
When nothing is selected on a chart, have a floating arrow that will point to a column or row
Have symbols enlarge on hover
Background Music
Have a counter for how many reps someone has gotten (requires backend)
Change play button art to a wug with a play button in the middle
Indicate to the user for the first time that they can highlight a cell
Phighting Phonetics
Think about logo
Add default text to the to work on bar
Make dropdown highlighting better
Make the feedback play sounds
Change toggle function for colspan of non-pulmonics
Don't highlight non-symbols

Questions to ask:
- How do I show/tell the user that they can select columns?
    Add tooltip/one time arrow pointing to something
- How do I show/tell the user that they can click on the buttons to replay the audio?
