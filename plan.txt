So, first I want to figure out what I want to have on the application.

RESUME IDEA: write something like
integrated the ___ dataset for over ___ english word transcriptions to train on

Have weighted recognition - either with a manual feedback system or by percentage
Give an indicator for a streak - two in a row!! :o

sound recognition
- IPA trainer for english sounds (consonants on one page, vowels on the other)
    Given sound, identify symbol (monopthongs and dipthongs)
    Given aspects of articulation, name the symbol (ex: voiceless bilabial stop, p)
    When wrong, show them what the correct answer is, and let them find it themselves
    Perhaps a multiple choice mode
    Also, get a selection for sounds you are comfortable with and want to block
    Also, get an autorecommendation system for any sound that you have less than 75% accuracy with
- IPA trainer for english words
    ...
- IPA trainer for all sounds (consonants, vowels)
    Given sound, identify symbol
- IPA trainer for clicks, ejectives, and implosives (Airstream Mechanics)
    Given click, ejective, or implosive, identify it
- Diacritic training
    PROBLEM: HAVE NO RESOURCES TO DO THIS!!! ASK ABOUT THIS

font-family: 'Milonga', cursive;

- Spectrogram training (Acoustic phonetics, vowels (general))
    Given highlighted area in spectrogram, identify the type 
    When wrong, show them the valid information from the slides, along with what they got wrong
    ALSO PROBLEM WITH GETTING EXAMPLES
- Tone training
    ALSO SAME PROBLEM, WHAT RESOURCE WOULD I IMPLEMENT THIS WITH?
- Gestural scores
    Given a word, create the gestural scores
    LOW PRIORITY ^^^^ THIS SEEMS KINDA HARD TO MAKE NGL
